                GaroonHub was born out of the frustration of missed games, double bookings, and the
                hassle of manually reserving soccer turfs. We saw an opportunity to bring the
                beautiful game into the digital age. From a simple idea to a growing tech solution,
                weâ€™re on a mission to connect players and turf owners across East Africa through a
                seamless, modern platform. With GaroonHub, finding a turf, booking a match, and
                managing your facility is just a tap away.
