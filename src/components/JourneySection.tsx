          GaroonHub was officially founded in May 2024, but the idea was born long before that — in the hearts of young players, community organizers, and stadium owners who were all frustrated by the same issue: the outdated and inefficient way football  games were being organized. Booking a stadium involved endless phone calls, last-minute cancellations, poor coordination, and often, missed opportunities to play the game we love.
We saw this as more than just a logistical issue. It was a barrier to connection, to health, to joy. Our team shared one core vision: to revolutionize how people access and enjoy football  across East Africa.
From day one, our mission was crystal clear — make football  more accessible, more convenient, and more enjoyable for everyone. Whether you're an amateur player, a student group, or a local stadium owner, GaroonHub exists to remove the friction and bring in simplicity.
Today, GaroonHub is growing into a digital ecosystem — one that not only helps players find and book nearby fields but also gives stadium managers powerful tools to manage their facilities, boost revenue, and engage their local communities.
And we're just getting started.
The Genesis of GaroonHub
Before there was GaroonHub, there was an idea that turned into a broader vision: GoPlay.
We started with a deep belief in something timeless: sports have the power to unite people, encourage healthy lifestyles, and create thriving communities. But the question we kept asking was — why is something so universal made so hard to access?
Booking a football  field shouldn't feel like solving a puzzle. It should be simple, transparent, and even exciting. That’s why GoPlay was born — as a parent platform built to power new digital experiences in sports and entertainment. It laid the groundwork for products like GaroonHub that bring smart, accessible, and scalable solutions to the grassroots level.
GoPlay represents our larger dream: a future where technology empowers play, where athletes and communities have better tools, and where every person — young or old — can access the joy of sport.

          Our journey began with a simple but persistent problem: the chaos and confusion surrounding football field bookings. As passionate players and organizers, we experienced the frustration of missed matches, double bookings, and the outdated process of manually calling or visiting turfs to reserve a slot. It was clear that something had to change.

That’s when GaroonHub was born — not just as a product, but as a purpose-driven solution. We asked ourselves: What if finding and booking a turf was as easy as ordering a ride or food online? That question sparked an idea, and the idea grew into a mission: to digitize and simplify how East Africa plays football.

We started small — identifying pain points for both players and turf owners. Players needed quick access to reliable bookings. Turf owners needed efficient tools to manage their schedules, reduce no-shows, and grow their visibility. By listening closely to both sides, we built GaroonHub as a platform that brings the entire football community together in one smart ecosystem.

From our first prototype to the feature-rich platform we’re launching today, our focus has remained the same: empower players to play more, and help turf owners manage better. Whether you're a weekend warrior looking for your next match or a facility owner trying to fill time slots and grow your business, GaroonHub is your digital teammate.

We’re proud to be leading a movement to modernize local sports infrastructure — starting with football, but dreaming bigger. With just a few taps, you can find nearby fields, check availability in real-time, book your match, or manage your entire facility — all in one place.

GaroonHub is more than a booking app — it's a bridge between tradition and technology, community and convenience, players and opportunities.

And this is only the beginning.
