            Founded in May 2024, GaroonHub emerged from a passionate vision to transform how people 
            experience soccer in East Africa. We saw a challenge: the complicated, inefficient process of 
            finding and booking soccer turfs. Our mission? To make soccer accessible, convenient, and 
            enjoyable for everyone.

            Our story began with a simple yet powerful belief: sports have the ability to bring people 
            together, promote healthy lifestyles, and build vibrant communities. We recognized that 
            finding the right soccer pitch shouldn't be a hassle â€“ it should be simple, transparent, and 
            fun.
